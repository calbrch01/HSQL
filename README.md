# HPCC Systems Structured Query Language ( H-SQL )

## ‚≠ê What is H-SQL?

<b>H-SQL is the new big data query language of the HPCC systems ! </b>

It leverages a declarative SQL like syntax and translates to [Enterprise Control Language (`ECL`)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECL_(data-centric_programming_language)>). It can also work in conjunction with ECL to allow a team of data science developers to explore and analyze big data across a high performance computing cluster without the programmer being involved in many of the lower level, imperative decisions.

<b><i>It is designed mostly for SQL developers that are interested in developing on the HPCC systems platform.</i> </b>Using H-SQL, developers should easily adapt to the HPCC systems platform and start working with big-data right away.
